```
```{r loops_example2}
# Herein lies an important lesson about R. "Looping" through
# operations can be quite slow when you are coding something
# more complicated. It is good practice to always think about
# ways to avoid loops by harnessing the power of matrix/vector
# manipulation in R. For example, we can restore the vector x
# to hold its original values by writing another loop, or, we
# can make a sequence from 1 to the length of x like this

# 1:length(x)

# and subtract it all at once like this

x = x - (1:length(x)) # 2 -1  4  0 -6  2
```
```{r while_loops}

# Conditionals

```{r conditionals}

y = rep(0,length(x))   # repeat 0, length(x) times

for (i in 1:length(x))
{
    if(x[i]<=5)
    {
        y[i] = 1
    }
    else
    { 
        y[i] = -1          
    }           
}

# The same result can be achieved with the following code
y <- rep(-1, length(x))
y[x <= 5] <- 1
```
# Matrices
```{r matrices}
x = c(3,1,7,4,-1,8)
y = c(2,7,-2,4,0,3.3)

A = matrix(0,6,6)

A[1,] = x
A[2,] = y
A[3,] = x + y
A

# As in the case with vectors, typing A*A will perform elementwise
# multiplication. In order to perform actual matrix multiplication,
# where elements come from dot products between columns and rows, we would type A%*%A.
# To get the inverse of a matrix we use the solve(A) function.
```
# Data Frames
```{r data_frames}
# A "data frame" is like a matrix but is far more flexible as it can consist of many
# different types of data

dogs$name<-as.character(dogs$name)
dogs$age<-as.numeric(dogs$age)

# Plotting

```
```{r plotting_histogram}
hist(dogs$weight) # frequency
```

```{r plotting_histogram2}
# The histogram that we just made has "Frequency" on the  𝑦
#  -axis. In this case, the height of each bar represents the total number of dogs in the data
#  set whose height falls in the ranges that make up the bases ("bins") of the rectangles. Throughtout
#  this course, we will want to use "Density" instead of "Frequency". When the  𝑦
#  -axis uses "density", the height of each bar will be such that the total are of each bar is
#  the proportion of dogs whose weight falls into the associated range. This will become an estimate of
#  the probability of any dog's weight being in that range if we were to sample more dogs. Run the next cell.
hist(dogs$weight,prob=T) # density
```
```{r plotting_histogram3}
# Let's check out the proportion of dogs in our sample whose weight is less than 5 units.
length(dogs$weight[dogs$weight<5])/length(dogs$weight)

# Note that the first rectangle has base width  5
#   and therefore area  (5)(0.04)=0.2
#  .
# Finally, let's change the width of the bins of this histogram. That is,
# let's change where we put the "breaks" and make each bar only 2 units wide. We will
# make a sequence of numbers that will cover the range of the data. (We have already checked the
# range of the data by typing min(dogs$weight) and
# max(dogs$weight) )

br<-seq(0,24,2)
hist(dogs$weight,prob=T,breaks=br)
